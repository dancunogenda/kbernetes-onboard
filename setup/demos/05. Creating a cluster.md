# Creating a cluster takes a little while, so we will create one via the command line 
# before we expoore the UI. Run the following command in cloud shell

gcloud container clusters create cluster-demo --zone us-central1-a --machine-type "n1-standard-2" --num-nodes "3" --enable-cloud-logging --enable-cloud-monitoring  --scopes "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform" 


# Navigate to kubernetes engine in the console and show how to create a cluster 
# called cluster-demo2 as follows, explaining the options as you go. 
# This is just for info - you created it with the command line script above


name: cluster-demo2
location type: zonal

# click on Advanced Edit, under Node pools. Show configuration of underlying 
# machines, and ability to add kubernetes labels (which we'll talk about later). 
# Show the ability to set API access. We do that in the script.

# Show the other advanced options, and then point out that the same cluster 
# can be created at the command line, and we've done so. 

# Then cancel and return to the slides. Cluster creation will take some time...
