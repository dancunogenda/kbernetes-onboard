# Why Kubernetes Engine?

# navigate to kubernetes engine in the console and show how to create a cluster called cluster-demo as follows, explaining the options as you go. 
# This is just for info - you are going to create it with the command line script lower down in this document

name: cluster-demo
location type: zonal

# click on Advanced Edit, under Node pools. Show configuration of underlying machines, and ability to add kubernetes labels (which we'll talk about later). One the script sets is:

scopes: Allow full access to all Cloud APIs

# show the other advanced options, and then point out that the same cluster can be created at the command line. Then cancel out of the console.

# open cloud shell and run the following command to create the cluster

gcloud container clusters create cluster-demo --zone us-central1-a --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --num-nodes "3" --enable-cloud-logging --enable-cloud-monitoring  --scopes "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only","https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform"
