# Modify the frontend yaml file as follows:

# 1. change the deployment's api version to:

apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1

# 2. add an additional label 'env: production' in the template metadata, on the next line and same at the same indent level as 'app: hip-local-ui'

        env: production


# That's it for the existing deployment. The canary release needs a new deployment based on the existing one.  Copy the entire deployment (including the api version and the ---), and paste it directly beneath the --- of the existing one.

# Make the following changes to the new deployment:

    name hip-local-ui-staging    (from hip-local-ui)
    number of replicas   1       (from 3)
    image: gcr.io/kr-dr-temp-hip/ui:v0.2  (from v.02)
    env: staging         (from production)


# The entire yaml for the new deployment follows for reference:

# run apply again in the frontend folder

kubectl apply -f kubernetes-config.yaml

# then examine the pods

kubectl get pods

# you should soon see one pod id contains 'staging' 

# OPTIONAL: visit the page repeatedly until you see the new message - it might take a while (not least becasue the pod has to be ready before it serve: when testing, I had to click 20 times to get the 1-in-4 to come up...)

# OPTIONAL: have everyone visit the page - some will get the staging version
