# The boss has decided she was wrong to just abandon our new version.
# She wants us to do a canary release instead...

# Modify the frontend yaml file by:

# 1. changeing the deployment's api version to:

apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1

# 2. add an additional label 'env: production' in the template metadata production as follows:

  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hip-local-ui
        env: production

# That's it for the existing deployment. Now we need another deployment based on the 
# existing one, but with new:
#   name  hip-local-ui-staging
#   label  env: staging
#   number of replicas   1
#   image: gcr.io/kr-dr-temp-hip/ui:v0.2

# The following yaml does all of these. Paste it (including the --- at the beginning) 
# immediately before the --- at the end of the existing deployment

# run apply again in the frontend folder

kubectl apply -f kubernetes-config.yaml

# then examine the pods

kubectl get pods

# you should soon see one pod id contains 'staging' 

# OPTIONAL: visit the page repeatedly until you see the new message - it might take a while!

# OPTIONAL: have everyone visit the page - some will get the staging version
