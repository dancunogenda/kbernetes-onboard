# We have a working app - now we need to move it into the cloud for scale and reliablity

# Open a cloud shell window and the code editor.  Navigate to the frontend folder 
# in the editor AND cloud shell and create a new file named:

Dockerfile

# The complete file is below - here are the steps:

# 1. retrieve a python 3 image

FROM python:3

# 2. copy over everything from the room

COPY . .

# 2. install the dependencies

RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# 4. start the app

CMD [ "python3", "./main.py" ]

# save the file and then build it locally as a new container, test:

docker build -t test .

# run the file

docker run --env GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=kr-dr-temp-hip  --rm -p 8080:8080 test

# use preview on 8080 to show the app 
# WARNING! if you are doing this in the same environment when you ran docker commands 
# (whether cloud shell or lcoally), the previous space invaders app will 
# probably be cached on 8080 - if so force a hard refresh  by holding down the SHIFT key 
# as you click on the refresh icon
   s
# The app should work, but with no backend. There will be a message telling you that 
# the events service is not running.

# use ctrl+c to stop and delete the running container

# open main.py in editor and show the following line (around 51)

model['greeting'] = os.getenv('GREETING', 'Welcome to Hip Local')

# we can retrieve a greeting from the env.  Let's add one for docker. Add the following 
# line just before the CMD line in the Dockerfile

ENV GREETING 'Welcome to Hip-Local in Docker'

# Save the file and then build as test2:

docker build -t test2 .

# Run the file, then preview on 8080 and show the welcome statement

docker run --env GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=kr-dr-temp-hip --rm -p 8080:8080 test2

# use ctrl+c to cancel and delete the container


# use the editor to create a new Dockerfile in the backend folder, and paste in the following:

FROM launcher.gcr.io/google/nodejs
COPY . /app/
WORKDIR /app
RUN npm install 
CMD ["npm", "start"]

# save the file and then cd in cloud shell into ../backend and build as test3:

cd ../backend
docker build -t test3 .

# run the file 

docker run --env GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=kr-dr-temp-hip  --rm -p 8081:8081 test3

# use preview, and change the port to 8081 
# The result will be underwhelming - it will show an empty array [] 
# modify the url so it ends as follows:

.com/happenings

# you should see a json version of the existing happenings

#DONE



# The complete frontend docker file is:
FROM python:3
COPY . .
RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt
ENV GREETING 'Welcome to Hip-Local in Docker'
CMD [ "python3", "./main.py" ]
