# either locally (if you have docker installed) or in cloud shell

docker run -d krattan/spaceinvaders:v0.1

# this pulls down and runs the image - but not exposed yet, so can't play it explain that -d detaches so you continue to have the command line

# list the images

docker images

# list the running containers - show that is running

docker ps

# grab the id and ssh into the container

docker exec -it [containerId] /bin/bash

# install curl

apt-get update; apt-get install curl

# show the content is there and running

curl http://127.0.0.1/index.html

# exit back to cloud shell

exit

# attempt to delete an image - fails: image in use

docker images
docker image rm [id]

# try to delete running container - fails, container running

docker ps
docker rm [id]

# stop the container 

docker stop [id]
docker rm [id]

# run it again - but this time add -p 8080:80 , which allows you to use 8080 locally (or in cloud shell) to target 80 on the pod.  (The --rm is there to delete the container when it's stopped [or when you hit ctl+c if you're running it locally]).

docker run --rm -d -p 8080:80 krattan/spaceinvaders:v0.1

# if on local machine, open localhost:8080 and play the game
# if on cloud shell, use preview on port 8080 and play the game

# end

ctrl+c 
# (or docker ps followed by docker stop in using cloud shell)

#DONE

# OPTIONAL: delete the image

docker images
docker image rm [id] -f
