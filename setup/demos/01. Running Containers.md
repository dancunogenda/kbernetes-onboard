# You are going to run some docker commands. You can do this locally on your machine 
# if you have docker installed, or directly in cloud shell if you prefer

# Run the following command to pull down a docker image

docker run -d krattan/spaceinvaders:v0.1

# this pulls down and runs the image - but no ports are exposed yet, so you can't play it 
# explain that -d detaches the image so you continue to have the command line

# list the images

docker images

# list the running containers - show that is running

docker ps


# grab the id and ssh into the container

docker exec -it [containerId] /bin/bash

# OPTIONAL - install curl and show the app. instructions at end.

# OPTIONAL section

# install curl

apt-get update; apt-get install curl

# show the content is there and running

curl http://127.0.0.1/index.html

# END OPTIONAL section

# exit back to cloud shell

exit

# attempt to delete an image - fails: image in use

docker images

docker image rm [id]

# try to delete running container - fails, container running

docker ps
docker rm [id]

# stop the container 

docker stop [id]
docker rm [id]

# run it again - but this time add -p 8080:80, which allows you to use 8080 locally 
# (or in cloud shell) to target 80 on the pod.  (The --rm is there to delete the 
# container when it's stopped.

docker run --rm -d -p 8080:80 krattan/spaceinvaders:v0.1

# if on local machine, open localhost:8080 and play the game
# if on cloud shell, use preview on port 8080 and play the game


# stop the container (which also deletes it)

docker ps
docker stop [id]

#DONE

# OPTIONAL: delete the image (-f is for force, just in case)

docker images
docker image rm [id] -f
