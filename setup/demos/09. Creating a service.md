# Run apply again

kubectl apply -f kubernetes-config.yaml

# Get details of the service - repeat until external IP is created

kubectl get services

# once you have an external ip, open a browser and browse to it. You might want 
# to break from the demo again, and return in a few slides time, rather than 
# wait for the assignment

http://[ip]/

# It works (the the backend/events service isn't running yet) - but it says 
# it's running in docker, and we're now beyond that.  Let's pass in an env 
# variable saying we're in kubernetes - and see which is applied.

# Go back to the deployment and add another env variable  for the greeting 
# and prove the pod is receiving env variables correctly:

        - name: GREETING
          value: "Welcome to Hip Local running on Kubernetes"   

# Last time did this, with a single pod, we had to delete and recreate. 
# What happens if we try kubectl apply with a deployment?  Does that work?

kubectl apply -f kubernetes-config.yaml

# Yes it does.  And which greeting will we see - docker or kubernetes? 
# Browse to it again and find out

http://[ip]/

# You should see the frontend - with the kubernetes env message.

# Give everyone the ip, and have people in the room browse to it.

# We have a way to go yet, though. Not only do we have to deploy the 
# backend, the login won't work. Click on the login button - an error 
# will come up. We need to assign an authorized domain. And for that, 
# we need an ingress...
