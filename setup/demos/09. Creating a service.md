# return to the yaml file in frontend

# add the following at the end of the file, including the ---

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata: 
  name: hip-local-ui-svc
spec: 
  ports: 
     -  port: 80

# and while we're at it... we're going to be seeing the page
# in a browser.  Let's go back to the deployment, add another env variable 
# for the greeting and prove the pod is receiving env variables correctly:

        - name: GREETING
          value: "Welcome to Hip Local running on Kubernetes"   

# run apply again

kubectl apply -f kubernetes-config.yaml

# get details of the service

kubectl get services

# once you have an external ip, open a browser and browse to it.

# You should see the frontend - with the env variable message, 
# and a panel saying the event service isn't running - we haven't
# deployed the backend yet. That's not the only issue: The login 
# won't work either without the domain.

# give everyone the ip, and have people in the room browse to it.

#DONE
