# CANNOT BE CREATED INSIDE ACTUAL LOAD 
# would need to commit all the work not in the base...
# so this is just notes for when I run through a complete test
# at which point I can write it properly

# set up a tag based build trigger
# be sure to set the container name correctly...

Tag
frontend
gcr.io/kr-dr-temp-hip/ui:$TAG_NAME

# go into frontend main.py and change app setting greeting to hardcoded "hello from x"

git commit -A
git commit -m "Change to greeting"
git push origin hiplocal

git tag v0.2-lw
git push hiplocal --tags

[[
# how to delete - don't need to do htis, but want it here for referece
git tag -d v0.2-lw
git push hiplocal :refs/tags/v0.2-lw
]]

# observe the build.

# modify the yaml to use the new tag and apply the config

# watch the turnover, see the new greeting

# oh no - people elsewhere are not happy... The boss wants us to roll back immediately
# no problem - change yaml and apply

# return of the old version
