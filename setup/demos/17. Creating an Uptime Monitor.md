# Go to Monitoring in the web console

# Click the button to create your free workspace

# Select the onboard project

# skip AWS setup

# continue past the setting up logging and monitoring screen.  Point out that our original command creating the cluster already enabled both of them with the following flags:

--enable-cloud-logging --enable-cloud-monitoring  

# select no reports and continue

# click 'launch monitoring'

# click 'create check' under Monitor Uptime

# you will be offered checks on App Engine.  Deselect them and choose 'no thanks'.  You will then be offered the modal window to setup your uptime check. Fill it in as follows:

Title:  HipLocal Kubernetes Uptime Check
check type: HTTP
resource type: URL
host hame: hipkube.kwikstart.net
path: /health
check every: 1 minute

# show the advanced options, but don't set any.

# click 'test' to check that your uptime works.

# save the check

# click 'no thanks' on the alerting policy

# click on uptime checks, and then select 'HipLocal Kubernetes Uptime Check'. You will be taken to the dashboard. It will take a little while for anything to show, so go back to the slides and return to this at the very end - or show them a working version on another project of yours.
