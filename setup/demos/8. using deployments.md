# return to the yaml file in frontend

# modify the top two lines as follows:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment

# move down below labels, and add this at the same indent level as apiVersion

spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hip-local-ui
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hip-local-ui

# delete everything below this point, and replace with the following
# it's the same, but the indent level has moved into the template for
# the replicaset

    spec:
      containers:
      - name: hip-local-ui
        image: gcr.io/kr-dr-temp-hip/ui:v0.1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
          name: "frontend-server"
        env:
        - name: APP_SETTINGS
          value: "config.KubernetesConfig"

# that's it for now - time to create the deployment

kubectl create -f kubernetes-config.yaml

# and let's see those objects

kubectl get pods
kubectl get deployments

# and let's scale them 

kubectl scale deployment --replicas=10 hip-local-ui 

kubectl get pods
kubectl get deployments

kubectl scale deployment --replicas=4 hip-local-ui 

kubectl get pods
kubectl get deployments

# we potentially were using a lot of resources with 10 pods
# it's time to specify, and limit, the resources for an individual pod

# add the following at the bottom of the yaml, at the same indent level as env:

        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "256Mi"
            cpu: "0.1"
          limits:
            memory: "512Mi"
            cpu: "0.5"

# we've changed our configuration - time to update the deployment

kubectl apply -f kubernetes-config.yaml

# there's a warning - did it work? run the following, and show the pod template section
# - yes, it worked

kubectl describe deployments

# now let's see the service in front of our pod

kubectl get services

# and let's try to curl from cloud shell (this will fail)

curl http://[clusterIp]:8080

# problem - no public ip
# we could use the command line again, but instead we're going to look at 
# how we define services in a more structured way using yaml

# leave the deployment running

#DONE
