# return to the yaml file in frontend

# modify the existing service definition from LoadBalancer to NodePort

  type: NodePort

# only need to expose the service inside the cluster. The ingress will 
# be the entrypoint

# navigate to VPC Network | External IP addresses
# show the students the static global IP address 'hip-local'

# OPTIONAL: show the students the DNS entry mapping this IP to hipkube.kwikstart.net

# add the following at the end of the file, including the ---

apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: hip-local-ingress
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.global-static-ip-name: "hip-local"
spec:
  backend:
    serviceName: hip-local-ui-svc
    servicePort: 80
  rules:
  - host: hipkube.kwikstart.net
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        backend:
          serviceName: hip-local-ui-svc
          servicePort: 80

# this will exposes the application on the DNS name hipkube.kwikstart.net

# finally, apply the configuration again. 

kubectl apply -f kubernetes-config.yaml

# This will take some time to work.  Show the students the Services 
# section in Kubernetes engine, and the message that the ingress is being created
# then go on with the slides. Hopefully, it will be complete by the time the
# next demo comes around.
