This onboard tells a story - how to move an application from the developer’s environment into kubernetes engine. The story is outlined underneath each of the demo slides, and you should read those as well as the background info below, and the detailed instructions in this repository.

The sample application is HipLocal.  This is an implementation of the case study from the Google Developer certification exam.

From the About page:

    "Who are we?
    HipLocal is a community application designed to facilitate communication between people in close proximity. It is used for event planning and organizing sporting events, and for businesses to connect with their local communities. HipLocal launched recently in a few neighborhoods in Dallas and is rapidly growing into a global phenomenon. Its unique style of hyper-local community communication and business outreach is in demand around the world.

    Going Global
    We are the number one local community app; it’s time to take our local community services global. Our venture capital investors want to see rapid growth and the same great experience for new local and virtual communities that come online, whether their members are 10 or 10000 miles away from each other."

The code/instructions usually refer to the events in the app as "happenings", and you should be ready to create a few (with images) before the onboard, so the site looks reasonable. e.g.:

    GCP Cocktail Party
    Our regular get togheter for local GCP developers is on this Friday. Bring a bottle and war stories. Share your adventures in developing apps for Kubernetes, Firestore and other parts of the GCP ecosphere.

Next step: check out the README.md in the setup folder for instructions on how to set up the  demos. This MUST be done in advance.
